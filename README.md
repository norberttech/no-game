# NoGame [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/norzechowicz/no-game.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/norzechowicz/no-game)

This repository is a proof of concept of 2D mmorpg game engine&client written in JS (es6).
It was made as a part of research done in my free time before paid project for my client. 

Following features are already implemented: 

- simple user login (username only) 
- player moves (up, down, left, right)
- map configuration (created with http://www.mapeditor.org/) 
- some basic but ugly sprites 
- simple battle system
- player health 
- possibility to die when monster is too hard to kill
- probably some other things that I don't remember now
- simple chat (players voice is visible to other players) 
- client&server communication protocols
- and probably some more that I don't remember now 

In order to make it playable you gonna need to implement following features:

- leveling system (based on experience) 
- improve battle system in order to support equipment (that is also not implemented) 
- prepare some better looking assets 
- add more tests (just to make sure that game is stable)
- add some persistence layer (at the moment when you shutdown server or when player logout his data is lost)
- and many many more...
