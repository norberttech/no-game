# Important commands

- ``$ npm run common:update`` - **Should be executed after any change in nogame common library**
- ``$ npm test `` - execute client test suite
- ``$ npm run client:build`` - execute server test suite
- ``$ npm run client:dev`` - run client in dev (watch) mode


# Development

In order to develop client without server launched (just to work on UI for example) you can open client url with
[https://client.nogame.local/?test=test](https://client.nogame.local/?test=test) test parameter.
This will initialize client with stub connection protocol (put anything into credentials to login).
